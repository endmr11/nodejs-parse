The scenario I've built in this project is as follows: When an order is placed by the customer, it is instantly added to the Admin panel.I used the **LiveQuery** feature of Parse Server as if it were a **socket**. I then listened in my Flutter app with **Parse Server SDK**. [My Flutter App is here](https://github.com/endmr11/flutter_parse_order_management)
